# Aurora Repo Boilerplate

A boilerplate that should be used to kickstart any new repositories. Should be kept up-to-date if new base is needed or upgraded packages become available.

Any private packages should follow these guidelines as well to produce the appropriate AuroraDao Private Package setup.

# .junk folder

Anything that is likely no longer needed but we are not ready to remove should be added to this directory. It will not be packaged when published to npm but currently is sent to git.
